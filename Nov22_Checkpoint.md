#Goal
This checkpoint will be to ensure that I am getting a my single-page app to
work, as well as getting most, if not all of my pages that display status 
(dashboard, jobs page) to update ithout reloading. This will be one of the
most critical areas for user experience on the whole site. It will also
be a large effort from myself. I have not done any AJAX-y web frontend 
work ever, and while many front-end technologies supply this as part of 
there API, I have a suspicion that there will be plenty of back-end work
to accomidate the functionality :)


#Current Status
Well... Other school projects too priority over this checkpoint, so I haven't done any
work on lwefd since the last checkpoint. The good thing is that it is spring break, 
and I plan on steadily working on lwefd to basically complete the project this week.
