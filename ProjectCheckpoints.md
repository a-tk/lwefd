#October 8
For this checkpoint I would really like to have a working end-to-end
backend for the site. This means for the site to be recieving notifications,
parsing them, and storing them in a sensible database. 

This is the first checkpoint with a large deliverable, but in my 
experience, it is the UI that takes the longest, and I am using a new
UI technology, so I expect for there to be some steep learning there.

This goal is all about getting backend work out of the way and functional!

#October 22
This should be the first UI checkpoint. I'd like to have a functioning 
dashboard page, along with a nice looking jobs page (the page that will
show all of the aggragated notifications). I have some great ideas for
displaying this information in an AJAX-y way, and I would like to have
time for that. 

#November 12
This checkpoint will be to ensure that I am getting a my single-page app to
work, as well as getting most, if not all of my pages that display status 
(dashboard, jobs page) to update ithout reloading. This will be one of the
most critical areas for user experience on the whole site. It will also
be a large effort from myself. I have not done any AJAX-y web frontend 
work ever, and while many front-end technologies supply this as part of 
there API, I have a suspicion that there will be plenty of back-end work
to accomidate the functionality :)

#December 3
Initial requirements met. I really hope that I will have some time to work
on stretch goals, especially the Raspberry Pi goal. For this reason I have put
a lot of my web sites basic functionality into the previous goals. That leaves
this deliverable for general polish/hardening, as well as stretch goals :)
