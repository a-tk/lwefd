## Web Technologies
Node.js webserver
Ext.js MVC framework
Angular.js
Sqlite DB


## Stretch Goals

### Metrics to track each systems state over time. 
This would be used to track software development trends, like codebase health
or development capability. 

### Email capability
Would be useful to notify based on CI System health. Jenkins and Travis already can
do this though.

### GPIO Pin support for a platform like Raspberry pi
